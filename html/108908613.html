<p>很巧合的在我登出“对MH17事件之分析”的同时，美国眾议员Ron Paul也写了一篇对MH17事件的评论文章。他觉得美国急着把这事件的责任赖到普丁的头上，是不诚实又不公平的。其实为什么美国全国动员，操弄媒体来打这口水仗是很明显的：CIA（中央情报局）策划乌克兰政变触动了俄国的戦略底线，促使普丁完全倒向中共；美国平时虽然还得装模作様做个假道学，既然已经撕破脸，就没有什么正义或真理的考量，从此美国对俄国的戦略目标只有一个，就是不择手段要把普丁搞下台。很明显的例子：显示一套山毛榉导弹发射系统正从乌克兰被转移到俄罗斯的一段类似视频是编造的，背景中的公告板显示视频是在小镇克拉诺阿梅斯克城拍摄的，该镇自5月11日以来一直在乌克兰政府军控制之下。</p>
<p>Ron Paul是美国联邦政府里唯一一个诚实又有见识的人。当然眾人皆醉我独醒，让他成了眾矢之的；一般美国媒体忙着骂他是疯子还来不及，更别想要登他的文章了，所以他只好开自己的网站。这篇文章如下（我的中文打字很慢，翻译的工作就交给打字强的读者了）：</p>

Just days after the tragic crash of a Malaysian Airlines flight over eastern Ukraine, Western politicians and media joined together to gain the maximum propaganda value from the disaster. It had to be Russia; it had to be Putin, they said. President Obama held a press conference to claim – even before an investigation – that it was pro-Russian rebels in the region who were responsible. His ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, did the same at the UN Security Council – just one day after the crash!<br/>
 <br/>
While western media outlets rush to repeat government propaganda on the event, there are a few things they will not report.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the crisis in Ukraine started late last year, when EU and US-supported protesters plotted the overthrow of the elected Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych. Without US-sponsored “regime change,” it is unlikely that hundreds would have been killed in the unrest that followed. Nor would the Malaysian Airlines crash have happened. <br/>
 <br/>
The media has reported that the plane must have been shot down by Russian forces or Russian-backed separatists, because the missile that reportedly brought down the plane was Russian made. But they will not report that the Ukrainian government also uses the exact same Russian-made weapons.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the post-coup government in Kiev has, according to OSCE monitors, killed 250 people in the breakaway Lugansk region since June, including 20 killed as government forces bombed the city center the day after the plane crash! Most of these are civilians and together they roughly equal the number killed in the plane crash. By contrast, Russia has killed no one in Ukraine, and the separatists have struck largely military, not civilian, targets.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the US has strongly backed the Ukrainian government in these attacks on civilians, which a State Department spokeswoman called “measured and moderate.”<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that neither Russia nor the separatists in eastern Ukraine have anything to gain but everything to lose by shooting down a passenger liner full of civilians.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the Ukrainian government has much to gain by pinning the attack on Russia, and that the Ukrainian prime minister has already expressed his pleasure that Russia is being blamed for the attack.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the missile that apparently shot down the plane was from a sophisticated surface-to-air missile system that requires a good deal of training that the separatists do not have.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report that the separatists in eastern Ukraine have inflicted considerable losses on the Ukrainian government in the week before the plane was downed.<br/>
 <br/>
They will not report how similar this is to last summer’s US claim that the Assad government in Syria had used poison gas against civilians in Ghouta. Assad was also gaining the upper hand in his struggle with US-backed rebels and the US claimed that the attack came from Syrian government positions. Then, US claims led us to the brink of another war in the Middle East. At the last minute public opposition forced Obama to back down – and we have learned since then that US claims about the gas attack were false.<br/>
 <br/>
Of course it is entirely possible that the Obama administration and the US media has it right this time, and Russia or the separatists in eastern Ukraine either purposely or inadvertently shot down this aircraft. The real point is, it's very difficult to get accurate information so everybody engages in propaganda. At this point it would be unwise to say the Russians did it, the Ukrainian government did it, or the rebels did it. Is it so hard to simply demand a real investigation?</p>
